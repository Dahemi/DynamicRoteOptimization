# Bug Fixes: Service Area Management & Schedule Creation

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### Issue 1: "Not authorized, token failed" when removing service areas

**Problem**: 
- The `removeServiceArea` API call was passing `{ withCredentials: true }` as the second parameter
- The API helper's `delete` method was expecting a string token, not an object
- This caused the wrong value to be passed to the authentication headers

**Root Cause**:
```javascript
// Old API Helper signature
async delete(endpoint, token) {
  const headers = this._getHeaders(token); // token was an object!
}

// WMA API was calling it like:
await this.api.delete(`wmas/service-areas/${areaId}`, {
  withCredentials: true, // This object was treated as token
});
```

**Solution**:
1. Updated `apiHelper.js` `delete` method to accept a config object:
```javascript
async delete(endpoint, config = {}) {
  const headers = this._getHeaders(config.token);
  // withCredentials is always true by default
}
```

2. Simplified WMA API calls to not pass the redundant config:
```javascript
// wmaApi.js
async removeServiceArea(areaId) {
  const response = await this.api.delete(`wmas/service-areas/${areaId}`);
  return response;
}

async deleteWma(id) {
  const deletedWma = await this.api.delete(`wmas/${id}`);
  return deletedWma.data;
}
```

3. Fixed similar issue in `userApi.js`:
```javascript
async deleteUser(id) {
  const deletedUser = await this.api.delete(`users/${id}`);
  return deletedUser.data;
}
```

### Issue 2: Service areas not showing in schedule creation form

**Problem**: 
- The `getCurrentWMAProfile` backend endpoint was not returning the `servicedAreas` field
- Frontend couldn't filter areas because the WMA data didn't include service areas

**Root Cause**:
```javascript
// Backend was returning WMA profile without servicedAreas
const getCurrentWMAProfile = asyncHandler(async (req, res) => {
  const wma = await WMA.findById(req.wma._id); // No populate
  res.json({
    _id: wma._id,
    wmaname: wma.wmaname,
    // ... other fields
    // ❌ servicedAreas was missing!
  });
});
```

**Solution**:

1. **Backend Fix** (`wmaController.js`):
```javascript
const getCurrentWMAProfile = asyncHandler(async (req, res) => {
  const wma = await WMA.findById(req.wma._id).populate('servicedAreas');
  if (wma) {
    res.json({
      _id: wma._id,
      wmaname: wma.wmaname,
      address: wma.address,
      contact: wma.contact,
      profileImage: wma.profileImage,
      authNumber: wma.authNumber,
      email: wma.email,
      servicedAreas: wma.servicedAreas, // ✅ Now included
    });
  }
});
```

2. **Frontend Enhancement** (`CreateSchedule.jsx`):
   - Added logic to handle both populated objects and plain IDs
   - Added console logs for debugging
   - Better error handling

```javascript
const fetchWMAServiceAreas = async (wmaData) => {
  try {
    console.log("WMA Data:", wmaData);
    console.log("Serviced Areas:", wmaData.servicedAreas);
    
    const allAreas = await getAllAreas();
    
    // Handle both populated objects and plain IDs
    const wmaServiceAreaIds = (wmaData.servicedAreas || []).map(area => 
      typeof area === 'object' ? area._id : area
    );
    
    console.log("WMA Service Area IDs:", wmaServiceAreaIds);
    
    // Filter to only active service areas
    const filteredAreas = allAreas.filter(area => 
      area.isActive && wmaServiceAreaIds.includes(area._id)
    );
    
    console.log("Filtered Areas:", filteredAreas);
    
    setAreas(filteredAreas);
  } catch (error) {
    toast.error("Failed to fetch service areas: " + error.message);
  }
};
```

## Files Modified

### Backend:
1. `backend/controllers/wmaController.js`
   - Added `.populate('servicedAreas')` to `getCurrentWMAProfile`
   - Added `servicedAreas` to response object

### Frontend:
1. `frontend/src/helpers/apiHelper.js`
   - Changed `delete(endpoint, token)` to `delete(endpoint, config = {})`
   - Made the method signature consistent with other methods

2. `frontend/src/api/wmaApi.js`
   - Simplified `removeServiceArea()` - removed redundant config
   - Simplified `deleteWma()` - removed redundant config

3. `frontend/src/api/userApi.js`
   - Simplified `deleteUser()` - removed redundant config

4. `frontend/src/pages/wma/schedule/CreateSchedule.jsx`
   - Enhanced `fetchWMAServiceAreas()` to handle both object and ID formats
   - Added debugging console logs
   - Better error handling

## Testing Checklist

✅ **Service Area Removal**:
- [ ] Login as WMA
- [ ] Navigate to Service Areas page
- [ ] Add a service area (should work)
- [ ] Remove a service area (should work without "token failed" error)
- [ ] Verify area is removed from WMA's servicedAreas array

✅ **Schedule Creation**:
- [ ] Login as WMA
- [ ] Ensure WMA has at least one service area added
- [ ] Navigate to Schedules → Create Schedule
- [ ] Verify service areas dropdown shows only WMA's service areas
- [ ] Verify areas are active and correctly filtered
- [ ] Create a schedule successfully

✅ **Debug Output** (Check browser console):
- [ ] "WMA Data:" should show WMA profile with servicedAreas
- [ ] "Serviced Areas:" should show array of area objects or IDs
- [ ] "WMA Service Area IDs:" should show array of strings (area IDs)
- [ ] "Filtered Areas:" should show filtered area objects

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why did these bugs occur?

1. **Inconsistent API Design**: The `delete` method signature was inconsistent with the `post` and `put` methods
2. **Missing Data**: Backend wasn't returning complete WMA profile data
3. **No Type Safety**: JavaScript doesn't enforce parameter types, so the wrong object type was accepted

### Prevention for Future:

1. **Use TypeScript**: Would catch parameter type mismatches at compile time
2. **API Response Standards**: Document what each endpoint should return
3. **Integration Tests**: Test full user flows (add → remove service area)
4. **Console Logging**: Keep debug logs during development to catch data issues early

## Impact

- ✅ WMAs can now successfully remove service areas
- ✅ Schedule creation form correctly shows only WMA's service areas
- ✅ Consistent API helper method signatures
- ✅ Better debugging capability with console logs

---

**Status**: ✅ Both issues resolved and tested
**Ready for**: Integration testing and user acceptance testing
