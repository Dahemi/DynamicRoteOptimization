## üéØ Test Flow

### Step 1: WMA Creates Schedule (This Assigns Area to Collector)

### Step 2: User Registers Bin & Sets Sensor to High

1. **Login as User**

2. **Register Bin** (if not already)
   - Navigate to: "Smart Bin" (sidebar)
   - If no bin registered:
     - Fill registration form
     - **Important**: Select the SAME area as the schedule (e.g., "Colombo 3")
     - Click on map to set location
     - Click "Register Bin"

3. **Update Sensor to High**
   - In "Sensor Control Panel"
   - Select: **"High"** or **"Full"**

   - Login with NIC and Truck Number

2. **View Full Bins**
   - Navigate to: "Full Bins" (sidebar)
   - ‚úÖ **Result**: You should now see the user's bin!
   
3. **Test Views**:
   - Click "List View" ‚Üí See bin card
   - Click "Map View" ‚Üí See bin marker on map
   
4. **Check Browser Console** (F12)
   - Should see logs:
     ```
     Full bins response: {success: true, count: 1, bins: [...]}
     Bins to display: [...]
     ```

---

### Step 4: Test Schedule Status Update

1. **While Still Logged in as Collector**
   
2. **View Schedules**
   - Navigate to: "Schedules" (sidebar)

     - Success toast appears

4. **Go Back to Schedules**
   - Schedule now shows "In Progress" status

5. **Mark Complete**
   - Click "Mark as Complete" button
   - ‚úÖ **Result**:
     - Status changes to "Completed"
     - Schedule moves to "Completed" section
     - Success toast appears

---

### Step 5: Collect the Bin

1. **Go Back to Full Bins**
   - Navigate to: "Full Bins"

2. **Collect Bin**
   - In List View: Click "Collect Bin" button
   - OR In Map View: Click marker ‚Üí Click "Collect" in popup
   
3. **Fill Dialog**
   - Enter weight (optional, e.g., "25")
   - Click "Collect Bin"
   - ‚úÖ **Result**:
     - Success message appears
     - Bin disappears from full bins list

4. **Logout Collector**

---

### Step 6: Verify User's Bin Reset

1. **Login as User Again**

2. **Check Bin Status**
   - Navigate to: "Smart Bin"
   - ‚úÖ **Result**:
     - Sensor shows "Empty (0%)"
     - Status shows "Collected"
     - Last collection date updated

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue: Collector Still Can't See Bins

**Check 1: Collector's Assigned Areas**
```bash
# In MongoDB Compass or shell
db.collectors.find({ collectorName: "John Doe" })

# Should show:
{
  "assignedAreas": ["area_id_here"]
}
```

**Fix**: If empty, create a NEW schedule for that collector in that area

---

**Check 2: Bin's Area Matches**
```bash
# In MongoDB
db.garbages.find({ binId: "BIN-..." })

# Check:
{
  "area": "area_id_here",  // Should match collector's assignedAreas
  "isVisibleToCollectors": true,  // Should be true
  "sensorData": {
    "fillLevel": "High" or "Full"  // Should be High or Full
  }
}
```

---

**Check 3: Browser Console**
- Open console (F12)
- Go to Full Bins page
- Look for logs showing API response
- If empty array, check above MongoDB queries

---

### Issue: Schedule Status Not Updating

**Check Backend Logs**
- Look for errors in terminal where backend is running
- Should see: `PUT /api/schedule/:id/status`

**Check Network Tab**
- F12 ‚Üí Network tab
- Click "Start Route"
- Look for `PUT` request to `/api/schedule/.../status`
- Check response status (should be 200)

---

### Issue: Map View Not Working

**Check Leaflet Loading**
- Internet connection required (uses OpenStreetMap)
- Check browser console for errors
- Should see map tiles loading

**Fallback**: Use List View instead

---
